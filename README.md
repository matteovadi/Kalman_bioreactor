# Kalman_bioreactor
Realization of multiple Matlab scripts for realizing a Kalman filter in a real problem with a bioreactor system.

This project has been realized within the course in Data and Decision Analysis at the University of Siena, together with Antonio Ugolini and Gabriele Belardi. The project dealt with a real bioreactor system; the aim was to design and implement an Extended Kalman filter for different mathematical formulation of the problem, as reported in the pdf file.
